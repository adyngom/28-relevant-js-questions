# The challenge

You might have to add all items in an array of numbers. You have been keeping up to date with new stuff in JS but are not sure that **sum()** is part of the Array prototype methods. 

Write a small program that will add all the items in an array of numbers and return the total using the Array **sum** function if it exists or using your custom function.

```javascript
 // should output 21
[1,2,3,4,5,6].sum();
// should be chainable and also output 21
[1,2,3].concat([4,5,6]).sum();
```
