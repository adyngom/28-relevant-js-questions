# The challenge

You might have to add all items in an array of numbers. You have been keeping up to date with new stuff in JS but are not sure that sum() is part of the Array prototype methods. 

Write a function that adds all the items in an array of numbers and return the total using Array.sum if it exists or using your custom function.

```javascript
// Using the javascript console, this statement:
[1,2,3,4,5,6].sum();  // should output 21
[1,2,3].concat([4,5,6]).sum(); // should also output 21
```
