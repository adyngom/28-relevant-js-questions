# The challenge

**_Best suited for:_** Junior | Senior **Stage:** Round 1 | Round 2

The “Super Developer Exam” is an online challenge that can be taken only once a year. Once submitted, it cannot be edited and all the answers become final.

To prevent and circumvent accidental submission issues, the UX team has tasked you to add a functionality that will only submit the final form after the user has pressed on the submit button three times.

Create a prototype that will have a button on a webpage with the text “Click three (3)to submit your answers”.

Once the user click on the button 3 times, display an alert to the window with the message “Your answers have been submitted. Relax and good luck :)”

After the submission, the button should be disabled.

**Bonus:** 3 being an experimental number, make your implementation flexible enough to accept any max number of clicks before firing.

Test it by adding a second button that accepts 2 clicks and another one that accepts 4
