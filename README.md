# 28 Relevant JavaScript Interview Questions
### A little perspective
For the past 12 years, I have been on both sides of the Front End Interview table. Sadly though, the emphasis is always put on Javascript during those rounds and the two other important languages — _HTML_ and _CSS_ — are not usually given the same weight.

Javascript though is very hard to cover as a whole since it has evolved from inside the DOM manipulation frame, to about anything that one sets their mind too. Let’s not even mention the plethora of Javascript libraries and frameworks that have sprouted all around like an army of bunnies following a long and harsh winter — Spring is coming!!

All jokes aside though, you could totally rock it at one interview and feel like you command the clouds, or be harshly knocked off the mountain tops in another.

The interview process as a whole is busted and has been a source of frustration for both the candidate and the companies trying to hire the right talent.

I have decided to add my modest contribution and I’m hoping to be a part of the solution here. I have been literally reading over hundreds of common interview questions and feel like a review and refactor of those are the key elements in fixing the bigger issue, but I need your help :)

I will be sharing a curated list of the ones that I have picked, adapted and sometimes created as most relevant to not only for a candidate to prepare but also for a company to assess one. It is obviously very opinionated but will hopefully become valuable and maybe a standard with the help and inputs from the JS community.
